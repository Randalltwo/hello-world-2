# hello-world-2
My first repository                        
A recent retiree, I have returned to a project I started a long time ago.
Raspberry Pi was very attractive to me as it was a bare-borns system that can take user tinkering.
My first project is a data logger and chart recorder with an ADS1115 analog to digital convertor
that will read up to four analog inputs, graph them on th erecorder, and save them to a disk file.
In addition a log file is created that tracks the operation of the package.
